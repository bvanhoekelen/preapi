# PreAPI ⏱

## Highlight
- Highly scalable and pro active caching system
- Reduce the load on your API
- Push your data to the cache before it is requested
- Don’t call us, we call you caching
- Quality control on requested data
- Default full cache control
- Easy to plug in into existing environments
- Extend API’s without changing your business logic
- Extremely fast responses to end users
- Batch caching
- Less errors and simpel to debug because data already exists before it is asked for
- No need for expensive CPU calculations, due to fast storage response

## Working
#### Normal data flow

## Examples
API responses come in three flavours: 
- Static response
    - Data that does’t change 
    - The same for everyone 
    - For example: archive of a news item
- Mixed response
    - Data that change much and/or groups users
- Dynamic response
    - Data that change for every call and for everyone 

You get the best performance with static and mixed responses

## Features
- Build in authorisation support ( `OAuth` | `Bearer oauth` | `JWT` | `client token` )
- Basic query filters like: ( `where` | `ordering` | `limit` )
- Linear & horizontally scalable
- Data quality control
- Easy to set up in an existing or new environment
- Program Language independent

## Help
This is my pro active caching concept. I’am looking for people who are willing to help me with this idea:
- People who know hardware limitations, and optimisations;
- Software developers that can help me write code client’s in different programming languages;
- Any other help and/or feedback on this concept.
